# Formating numbers to include seperators

To format a number to include seperators, for example making `1250500` appear as `1,250,500`, select the cells which have numbers in them and click on the `Home` tab. From there, select `Number` in the formating options. Then go to `More number formats`. From there, click the seperator checkbox.
