- [x] Completed the Unibuddy analysis project, comparing the Unibuddy product against application data to guage impact.
- [x] Created a dashboard for the TPC Contract renewal project. Mapped internal data with university partner data, creating a full data story dashboard to support the white paper.
- [x] Created a dashboard for the LGSC Contract renewal project. Mapped internal data with university partner data, creating a full data story dashboard to support the white paper.
- [x] Revamped the Navitas Annual Student Survey 2023 to reflect the new NSS format in the UK, as well as built the entire data pipeline process from start to finish.
- [x] Successfully trialed a Navitas Module Survey with 4 colleges, automating the survey and bringing data into Evidence and a singular dashboard for easy comparison and analysis of student experience across participating colleges.
- [x] Created a monthly insight snapshot report which goes out to EGMs and other key stakeholders, showing key monthly intelligence and emerging risks.
- [x] Took control of the Global Data Flows model for the Global Analytics Team, reverse engineering the scripts from R to Python, designing and building the engineering process into Evidence.

## Dashboards

- [x] Updated the Exception Report to a new, user efficient design, as well as added new exceptions to improve the data governance capabilities of UPE.
- [x] Updated the Academic Matrix to have an easy to use _Expected to Return_ page, showing the students expected to return and actuals who have. I also designed and implemented new visuals to understand **retention** and **attrition** at a glance.
- [x] Updated the Academic Matrix to a new UI/UX design, with a new Snapshot page featuring visual representations of key academic metrics. Also introduced an Agent Retention page, to see retention rate by Agent.
- [x] Updated the Turnaround Times report with a visual redesign, as well as implemented _Row Level Security_ to allow users to access deeper insights on admissions staff.
- [x] Redesigned the StudyLink Application Tracker to include a payment report, as well applications by specific statuses, ranked in the pipeline process order.
- [x] Created the new Application Turnaround Time Dashboard, which uses StudyLink data.
- [x] Created an automated pipeline in Databricks to download HESA table 28 whenever required, processing and wrangling data in Databricks before producing a detail aggregated dataset, showing market shares for every country and provider in the UK. I also created a Power BI dashboard for users to interact and explore the data.
- [x] Created the Retention Tracker, a global retention report that goes to Scott Jones and BGH.
- [x] Created the global report template and style guide, of which all new reports are based upon.
- [x] Reengineered and redesigned the Attendance Report from the ground up, producing a new report that has been greatly received by academic teams across the division.

## Data Engineering

- [x] Created a HESA products Python notebook that allows for fast, repeatable exporting of multi-year trend data for subjects in Higher Education. Used it within the BCUIC strategic plan project as well as the HESA regulatory dashboard.
- [x] Created the HESA table 28 automated pipeline to extract table when required, processing and wrangling data.
- [x] Improved the process of calculating Turnaround Time for colleges utilising StudyLink, creating a new dataset which allows for detailed analysis of specific actions on an application. I also improved the performance of reporting by moving the calculations to the server.
- [x] Created a bespoke export for BCUIC so they can provide critical data to their University Partner more efficiently, saving time and resources.
- [X] Created the Compliance Report in Power BI, automating the process from 4 days to less than 5 minutes.
- [x] Created X0062 exception.
- [x] Created X0063 exception.
- [x] Created X0064 exception.
- [x] Created X0066 exception.

- [x] Conducted a review of the Progression measure, creating documentation to outline expected administration within Navigate in order to ensure this measure is calculated properly.
- [x] Resolved an issue affecting global divisions and application volume calculation, whereby a specific scenario was not being accounted for in our codebase, resulting in applications not being counted where this scenario was occuring. This discovery and change led to correct calculations of applications, improving confidence in our data.
