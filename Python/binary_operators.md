| a + b        | Add a and b                                                                                  |
| a - b        | Subtract a from b                                                                            |
| a * b        | Multiply a by b                                                                              |
| a / b        | Divide a by b                                                                                |
| a // b       | Floor-divide a by b, dropping any franctional remainder (return whole number)                |
| a ** b       | Raise a to the b power                                                                       |
| a & b        | True if both a and b are true; for integers, take the bitwise                                |
| a ^ b        | For booleans, True if a or b is True, but not both; for integers, take the bitwise EXCLUSIVE |
| a == b       | True if a equals b                                                                           |

| a <= b, a < b| True if a is less than (less than equal or equal) to b                                       |
| a > b, a >= b| True if a is greater than (greater than or equal) to b                                       |
| a is b       | True if a and b reference the same Python object                                             |
| a is not b   | True if a and b reference different Python objects                                           |
