# Calculating Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)

CAGR allows you to see growth rate over time. It lets you see what the rate of return needs to be for the value to grow from its starting value to the end value.

(`end_value` / `starting_value`) ^ (1/ `number_of_years`)-1

## Using RRI Formula within Excel

The Excel RRI function returns an equivalent interest rate for the growth of an investment. You can use RRI to calculate Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) in Excel.

`=RRI(number_of_years, first_value, end_value)`

`=RRI(3, A2, D2)`
