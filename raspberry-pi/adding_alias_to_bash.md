# Adding alias to bash

This is useful for when you want to create a new short alias for a function or command in the Terminal.

To add an new alias, edit the `bash` file:

`sudo nano ~/.bashrc`

In the `alias` section, you can add a new line of code for an new `alias`:

`alias shortcut='bash command'`

For example:

`ipython='python3 -m IPython'`
