# Install programs from the command line

This can be done by downloading `.deb (debian)` files and then using the following `terminal` command:

```command prompt
sudo dpkg -i <path-to-file>
```

You can also install all `debian` files in a directory using:

```command prompt
sudo dpkg -i path/to/directory/*.deb
```
