# Exporting Markdown from VS Code

VS Code has an extension available that allows for the easy exporting of Markdown files to a number of types, called [Markdown PDF](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzane.markdown-pdf#usage).

Exporting can be done by pressing `F1` or `Ctrl+Shift+P` and select one of the export options.
