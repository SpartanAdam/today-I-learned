# Adding files (staging changes)

## Add all files

To stage all changes and add all files, we can use the command:

`git add -A`

`-A` stages all changes and files.

## Add files by extension type

We can also add files by extension type:

`git add *.txt`

`git add *.py`

## Adding files in the current directory

This can be doing using `.` (dot):

`git add .`

>Note: This will add only changes made within that directory/ files within that directory
