# Create a new branch

Creating new branches from the git command line can be done with the following command:

`git checkout -b <branch-name>`

A new branch is created and you switch to the branch automatically.

## Create a branch without switching

You can do this using the `branch` command:

`git branch <branch_name>`

or

`git -b <branch_name>`

You can then switch to the branch using the `checkout` command:

`git checkout <branch_name>`
