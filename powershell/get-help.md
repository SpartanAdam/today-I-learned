# Get help

To check the syntax of a cmdlet or how it works, you can use the `help` command, for example:

```powershell
help Get-ChildItem
```

Would return details on how the cmdlet works as well as its syntax.

You can also get even further help by passing the `-online` option, which will open a web browser window and show documentation, for example:

```powershell
help Get-ChildItem -online
```
